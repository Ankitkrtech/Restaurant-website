# ZaikaRestaurant


•This is a concept website which we build for the Indian people.

•Food has always been the integral part of India.

•We decided to make a fully responsive restaurant website.

•It uses frontend and backend with database management system by localhost.

•The website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap and DBMS.

•The hosting will have to be done on a local host which is provided by Xampp Server.

•We have used MyPhpAdmin server to make the backend part.
